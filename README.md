# Gen-AI-with-LSTM---Text-Generation
# 🧠 LSTM Text Generator (Word-level)

This project builds a **word-level text generation model** using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network trained on *William Shakespeare’s Complete Works*.  
The model learns to predict the next word in a sequence, generating new text in Shakespearean style.
